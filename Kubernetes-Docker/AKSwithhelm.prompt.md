# Technical Documentation Request: Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Architecture and Deployment

Please provide a comprehensive technical analysis of a multi-cloud Kubernetes architecture deployed across Azure (AKS) and AWS (EKS), including:

1. Traffic Flow Analysis
   - Detailed network topology diagrams
   - Ingress/egress patterns
   - Load balancing configuration
   - Cross-cloud communication mechanisms
   - Service mesh implementation (if applicable)

2. High Availability Architecture
   - Cluster design and node configuration
   - Region and zone distribution
   - Failover mechanisms
   - Backup and disaster recovery strategy
   - Monitoring and alerting setup

3. Helm-based Deployment Strategy
   - Complete Helm chart structure and hierarchy
   - Custom chart configurations for AKS and EKS
   - Values file organization
   - Dependencies and sub-charts
   - Release management process
   - Integration points with CI/CD pipeline

Include specific details for each cloud provider:
- Azure AKS configuration
- AWS EKS configuration
- Cross-cloud service discovery
- Security and compliance considerations

Deliverables:
- Architecture diagrams (Visio, draw.io, or similar)
- Helm chart documentation
- Network flow diagrams
- Configuration examples
- Infrastructure-as-Code samples (if applicable)

Please ensure all diagrams are clear, properly labeled, and follow cloud architecture best practices.
