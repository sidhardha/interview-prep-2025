Create a comprehensive guide on Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) architecture, covering key concepts and implementation details. Include:

1. Kubernetes Core Components:
   - Control plane components (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller manager)
   - Node components (kubelet, container runtime, kube-proxy)
   - Provide sample YAML manifests for each component configuration

2. Kubernetes Resource Management:
   - Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets
   - Services, Ingress, and Network Policies 
   - Storage Classes, PV/PVCs
   - ConfigMaps and Secrets
   - Resource quotas and limits
   Include working YAML examples for each resource type

3. AKS-specific Features:
   - Cluster architecture and node pools
   - Authentication and RBAC
   - Networking options (kubenet vs Azure CNI)
   - Storage integration with Azure Disks/Files
   - Azure Monitor integration
   - Azure AD integration
   Include Azure CLI commands and ARM templates where applicable

4. Production Best Practices:
   - High availability configuration
   - Scaling strategies
   - Security hardening
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Backup and disaster recovery
   - Cost optimization
   Include real-world scenarios and solutions

5. Troubleshooting Guide:
   - Common failure scenarios
   - Debugging techniques
   - Performance optimization
   - Log analysis
   Include diagnostic commands and procedures

Format requirements:
- Use diagrams to illustrate architecture and workflows
- Provide validated YAML manifests with comments
- Include official documentation references
- Structure content progressively from basic to advanced topics
- Focus on production-grade implementations
- Include security considerations for each topic
