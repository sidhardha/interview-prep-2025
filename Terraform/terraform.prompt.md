Provide a comprehensive explanation of key Terraform concepts, best practices, and implementation examples that are commonly asked in cloud engineering interviews. Focus on:

1. Infrastructure as Code fundamentals:
- Terraform workflow (init, plan, apply)
- State management
- Provider configuration
- Resource dependencies

2. Resource management:
- Creating, modifying, and destroying resources
- Resource blocks and syntax
- Data sources vs resources
- Meta-arguments (count, for_each, depends_on)

3. Variables and outputs:
- Variable types and declarations
- Local variables
- Output values
- Variable precedence

4. State management:
- Remote state storage
- State locking
- Workspace management
- Import existing resources

5. Modules:
- Module structure
- Input/output variables
- Module versioning
- Reusable module patterns

6. Advanced concepts:
- Provisioners
- Null resources
- Dynamic blocks
- Provider configuration

7. Best practices:
- Code organization
- Security considerations
- Tagging strategies
- State file management

Include practical examples for each concept, focusing on AWS, Azure, or GCP implementations. Also cover:
- Troubleshooting scenarios
- Performance optimization
- Collaboration workflows
- CI/CD integration
- Migration strategies
- Cost optimization

Provide actual code snippets and real-world use cases where appropriate.
