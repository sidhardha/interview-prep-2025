Here’s a detailed example of implementing Azure Landing Zones using the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), with practical steps and a real-world scenario:

# Azure Landing Zones & Cloud Adoption Framework – Detailed Example

## What is an Azure Landing Zone?
An Azure Landing Zone is a pre-configured, secure, and scalable environment that provides a baseline for workloads and applications. It includes core resources like networking, identity, security, governance, and monitoring, all aligned with best practices from the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF).

---

## Step-by-Step Example: Multinational Using Terraform

### 1. **Define Requirements**
- Standardize environments for multiple business units and regions.
- Enforce security, compliance, and governance from the start.
- Enable self-service for application teams.

### 2. **Choose a Landing Zone Implementation**
- Use the [CAF Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale) Terraform module for automation and scalability.

### 3. **Set Up Core Components as Code**
- **Management Groups:** Organize subscriptions by environment (e.g., Platform, Corp, Online).
- **Policies:** Enforce security (e.g., allowed locations, tag enforcement, resource locks).
- **RBAC:** Assign roles for platform, security, and application teams.
- **Networking:** Deploy hub-spoke topology, firewalls, and private endpoints.
- **Monitoring:** Set up Log Analytics, Azure Monitor, and Security Center.

#### Example Terraform Snippet (Management Group & Policy)
```hcl
module "eslz" {
  source  = "Azure/caf-enterprise-scale/azurerm"
  root_parent_id = "your-tenant-id"
  deploy_management_resources = true
  deploy_connectivity_resources = true
  deploy_identity_resources = true
  # ...other config...
}

resource "azurerm_policy_assignment" "allowed_locations" {
  name                 = "allowed-locations"
  scope                = module.eslz.root_id
  policy_definition_id = data.azurerm_policy_definition.allowed_locations.id
  parameters           = <<PARAMS
    {
      "listOfAllowedLocations": {
        "value": ["westeurope", "eastus"]
      }
    }
  PARAMS
}
```

### 4. **Deploy the Landing Zone**
- Use a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions) to deploy Terraform code.
- Validate deployment and ensure all resources are compliant.

### 5. **Onboard Workloads**
- Application teams deploy workloads into the landing zone subscriptions.
- Policies, RBAC, and monitoring are automatically enforced.

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:**  
A multinational company wants to enable multiple business units to deploy workloads in Azure, while ensuring global security and compliance.

**Actions:**
- Used the CAF Enterprise-Scale Terraform module to deploy landing zones in each region.
- Implemented policies to restrict resource locations, enforce tagging, and require encryption.
- Set up RBAC so platform teams manage networking/security, while app teams have Contributor access to their own subscriptions.
- Deployed hub-spoke networking with Azure Firewall and Private Endpoints.
- Enabled centralized monitoring and security with Log Analytics and Defender for Cloud.

**Outcome:**  
- Consistent, secure, and compliant Azure environments.
- Faster onboarding for new projects.
- Automated governance and cost management.
