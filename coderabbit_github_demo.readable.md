## 2. Core Features Demonstration (30 minutes)

### Automated Code Review
- Code Rabbit scans PRs for style, security, and logic issues
- Inline comments and suggestions are posted automatically

### AI-Powered Suggestions
- Contextual code improvements and refactoring tips
- Example: Suggests more efficient algorithms or flags anti-patterns

### Pull Request Analysis & Feedback
- Summarizes code changes and highlights risk areas
- Assigns review status (pass, needs changes, etc.)

### Code Quality Metrics & Reporting
- Provides dashboards for code coverage, complexity, and defect trends
- Exportable reports for team review

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Add Code Rabbit as a step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Example:
```yaml
- name: Code Rabbit Review
  uses: coderabbitai/action@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODERABBIT_TOKEN }}
```
