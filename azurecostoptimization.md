# Azure Cost Optimization Strategies

## 1. Use Azure Cost Management + Budgets
- Azure Cost Management provides dashboards, analytics, and reporting to monitor and control spending.
- Budgets allow you to set spending thresholds and receive alerts.

**How to Implement:**
- Go to the Azure Portal > Cost Management + Billing.
- Set up a budget for your subscription/resource group.
- Configure alerts to notify stakeholders when spending approaches or exceeds the budget.

**Example:**
A company sets a $10,000 monthly budget for its subscription. When 80% is reached, an alert is sent to the finance and engineering teams.

## 2. Right-size VMs, Use Reserved Instances, and Auto-shutdown Dev/Test Resources

**Right-size VMs:**
- Regularly analyze VM utilization using Azure Advisor or Monitor.
- Resize or deallocate underutilized VMs to smaller SKUs.

**Reserved Instances (RIs):**
- Purchase 1-year or 3-year RIs for predictable workloads to save up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go.
- Assign RIs to specific subscriptions or resource groups.

**Auto-shutdown Dev/Test Resources:**
- Enable auto-shutdown for VMs used in development or testing.
- Go to the VM > Operations > Auto-shutdown, set a daily shutdown time.

**Example:**
An enterprise reviews VM usage and finds several VMs running at <10% CPU. They resize these VMs and purchase RIs for production workloads. Dev/test VMs are set to auto-shutdown at 7 PM daily.

## 3. Implement Tagging for Cost Allocation
- Tags are key-value pairs assigned to resources for categorization (e.g., environment, department, project).

**How to Implement:**
- Apply tags like `Environment=Production`, `Department=Finance`, `Project=Ecommerce` to all resources.
- Use Azure Policy to enforce required tags.
- Use Cost Management to filter and analyze costs by tag.

**Example:**
A company tags all resources by department. At month-end, they generate a cost report by tag to allocate expenses to each business unit.

## 4. Review Advisor Recommendations
- Azure Advisor provides personalized best practices for cost, security, reliability, and performance.

**How to Implement:**
- Go to Azure Portal > Advisor.
- Review cost recommendations (e.g., right-size or shut down underutilized VMs, buy RIs, delete unused disks).
- Implement recommendations regularly.

**Example:**
Azure Advisor suggests shutting down 5 unused VMs and buying RIs for 10 always-on VMs. The company follows these recommendations and reduces costs.

## 5. Real-World Example

**Scenario:**
An enterprise was spending $100,000/month on Azure. By:
- Purchasing Reserved Instances for production VMs,
- Resizing or deallocating underutilized VMs,
- Enforcing auto-shutdown for dev/test VMs,
- Implementing tagging for cost tracking,
- Acting on Azure Advisor recommendations,

they reduced their monthly spend to $70,000â€”a 30% savings.
