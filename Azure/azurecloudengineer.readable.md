# Azure Senior Cloud Engineer Interview Guide

## Technical Assessment and Sample Questions

**Key focus areas:** Azure architecture, security, automation, DevOps, cost optimization, and enterprise solutions.

---

## Architecture & Design (Priority: High)

- **Designing a Highly Available, Multi-Region Azure Application**
  - Use Azure Traffic Manager or Front Door for global load balancing.
  - Deploy resources (App Service, AKS, databases) in paired regions.
  - Use Availability Zones for intra-region redundancy.
  - Geo-replicate data (e.g., Azure SQL Geo-Replication, GRS Storage).
  - Automate failover and test DR regularly.
  - *Example*: A global e-commerce platform uses Azure Front Door for routing, AKS clusters in East US and West Europe, and geo-replicated Cosmos DB.
  - [Designing reliable applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview)

- **Implementing Zero-Trust Security in Azure**
  - Enforce Conditional Access and MFA via Azure AD.
  - Use NSGs, Azure Firewall, and Private Endpoints to restrict network access.
  - Apply least privilege with RBAC and PIM.
  - Monitor with Azure Sentinel and Defender for Cloud.
  - *Example*: A financial services company implements Conditional Access, disables legacy authentication, and uses Just-in-Time VM access.
  - [Zero Trust Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/)

- **Azure Cost Optimization Strategies**
  - Use Azure Cost Management + Budgets.
  - Right-size VMs, use Reserved Instances, and auto-shutdown dev/test resources.
  - Implement tagging for cost allocation.
  - Review Advisor recommendations.
  - *Example*: An enterprise reduced costs by 30% by moving to reserved instances and automating VM shutdowns.
  - [Cost optimization best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview)

- **Azure Landing Zones & Cloud Adoption Framework**
  - Use landing zones for standardized, secure, and scalable environments.
  - Implement policies, RBAC, networking, and monitoring as code.
  - Align with Cloud Adoption Framework for governance and compliance.
  - *Example*: A multinational set up landing zones using Terraform, enforcing security and compliance from day one.

## Technical Expertise (Must Know)

- **Azure AD & RBAC:** Implement SSO, Conditional Access, custom roles, and PIM for least privilege.
- **Networking:** Design hub-spoke VNets, configure NSGs, and deploy Azure Firewall for segmentation.
- **IaC:** Use Bicep/Terraform for repeatable, versioned deployments.
- **Monitoring:** Set up Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and App Insights for end-to-end observability.
- **AKS:** Deploy multi-node pools, use managed identities, and integrate with Azure DevOps.
- **DevOps:** Build CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps, automate testing, and manage releases.

## Specific Technical Questions

1. **How do you handle secret management in Azure?**
   - Use Azure Key Vault for storing secrets, certificates, and keys. Integrate with managed identities for secure access.

2. **Explain Azure Front Door vs Traffic Manager vs Application Gateway**
   - Front Door: Global HTTP/HTTPS load balancing, WAF, SSL offload.
   - Traffic Manager: DNS-based global routing.
   - App Gateway: Regional L7 load balancer with WAF.

3. **Describe your experience with Azure Policy and compliance**
   - Use Azure Policy to enforce resource standards (e.g., allowed SKUs, tagging). Monitor compliance in Azure Security Center.

4. **How do you implement disaster recovery across Azure regions?**
   - Use paired regions, geo-replication, and Azure Site Recovery. Automate failover and test regularly.

5. **What's your approach to Azure resource tagging and governance?**
   - Apply tags for cost, environment, and ownership. Use Azure Policy to enforce tagging and track resources.

## Real-world Scenarios

- **Troubleshooting connectivity issues in hub-spoke networks**
  - Use Network Watcher, NSG flow logs, and effective security rules to diagnose connectivity.
- **Migrating on-premises applications to Azure**
  - Use Azure Migrate for assessment and migration, refactor apps for PaaS where possible.
- **Implementing automated scaling solutions**
  - Implement autoscale rules for App Service, AKS, or VMSS based on metrics.
- **Managing and optimizing Azure costs**
  - Set up budgets, alerts, and use cost analysis tools.
- **Securing PaaS services and data storage**
  - Use Private Endpoints, managed identities, and Key Vault integration.

## Best Practices & Documentation

- Follow the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/)
- Reference [Microsoft Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/)
- Ensure compliance (SOC, ISO, GDPR) using built-in Azure tools
- Prepare case studies highlighting problem-solving, architecture decisions, and outcomes

---

## Preparation Tips

- Prepare real examples for each topic (problem, solution, outcome).
- Review the latest Azure features and updates.
- Be ready to discuss collaboration, stakeholder management, and documentation practices.
