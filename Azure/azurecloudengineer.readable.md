## Architecture & Design (Priority: High)

- **Designing a Highly Available, Multi-Region Azure Application**
  - Use Azure Traffic Manager or Front Door for global load balancing.
  - Deploy resources (App Service, AKS, databases) in paired regions.
  - Use Availability Zones for intra-region redundancy.
  - Geo-replicate data (e.g., Azure SQL Geo-Replication, GRS Storage).
  - Automate failover and test DR regularly.
  - *Example*: A global e-commerce platform uses Azure Front Door for routing, AKS clusters in East US and West Europe, and geo-replicated Cosmos DB.

## Real-world Scenarios

- **Troubleshooting connectivity issues in hub-spoke networks**
  - In Azure hub-spoke architectures, connectivity issues can arise due to misconfigured routes, NSGs, or firewalls. To diagnose and resolve these issues:
    - **Network Watcher:** Use Connection Troubleshoot to test connectivity between VMs/subnets, and Packet Capture to analyze traffic flows. Example: If a spoke VM cannot reach a service in the hub, run Connection Troubleshoot from the spoke to the hub IP to identify where the traffic is blocked.
    - **NSG Flow Logs:** Enable NSG flow logs to capture allowed/denied traffic at the subnet or NIC level. Example: If traffic from a spoke to the hub is denied, review flow logs to see which NSG rule is blocking the connection.
    - **Effective Security Rules:** Use the "Effective Security Rules" feature in the Azure portal to view the combined effect of all NSGs applied to a VM or subnet. Example: If a VM in a spoke cannot access the hub, check effective rules to ensure required ports (e.g., 443, 1433) are allowed.
    - **Common Scenario:** A spoke VM cannot access a shared service in the hub (e.g., Azure Firewall, VPN Gateway). Steps:
      1. Use Network Watcher Connection Troubleshoot to test the path.
      2. Check NSG flow logs for denied traffic.
      3. Review effective security rules for missing or overly restrictive rules.
      4. Validate UDRs (User Defined Routes) to ensure correct routing between hub and spokes.
    - **Tip:** Always document and baseline your network security rules to simplify troubleshooting and ensure compliance.
- **Migrating on-premises applications to Azure**
  - Azure Migrate is a centralized service that helps you discover, assess, and migrate on-premises servers, databases, and applications to Azure. The typical process involves:
    - **Assessment:** Use Azure Migrate to inventory on-premises workloads, analyze dependencies, and assess readiness for Azure. Example: Scan a VMware or Hyper-V environment to identify which VMs are suitable for migration and estimate Azure costs.
    - **Migration:** Use Azure Migrate tools to move VMs, databases, and web apps to Azure. Example: Migrate a Windows Server VM to Azure as an Azure VM, or use Database Migration Service to move SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.
    - **Refactoring for PaaS:** Where possible, modernize applications by refactoring them to use Azure PaaS services (e.g., App Service, Azure SQL, AKS) instead of lifting and shifting to IaaS. Example: Instead of migrating a legacy .NET app to a VM, refactor it to run on Azure App Service for better scalability and management.
    - **Example Workflow:**
      1. Discover and assess on-premises servers with Azure Migrate appliance.
      2. Plan migration waves based on app dependencies and business priorities.
      3. Migrate VMs using Azure Migrate: Server Migration, or refactor apps for App Service or AKS.
      4. Validate, optimize, and decommission on-premises resources after successful migration.
  - **Tip:** Always consider security, cost, and operational benefits when choosing between lift-and-shift and refactoring for PaaS.
- **Implementing automated scaling solutions**
  - Automated scaling in Azure ensures your applications can handle varying loads efficiently and cost-effectively. You can implement autoscale rules for different Azure services:
    - **App Service:** Configure autoscale rules based on metrics like CPU usage, memory, or HTTP queue length. Example: Automatically increase the number of App Service instances when CPU usage exceeds 70% for 10 minutes, and scale down when it drops below 30%.
    - **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service):** Use the Cluster Autoscaler to add or remove nodes based on resource demands, and the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. Example: Scale out pods running a web API when average CPU usage exceeds 60%.
    - **VMSS (Virtual Machine Scale Sets):** Define autoscale rules to add or remove VMs based on metrics like CPU, memory, or custom Azure Monitor metrics. Example: Scale out VM instances when average CPU usage is above 75% for 5 minutes, and scale in when below 25%.
  - **Best Practice:** Always test autoscale rules in staging, monitor scaling events, and set minimum/maximum instance limits to control costs and ensure availability.
- **Managing and optimizing Azure costs**
  - Set up budgets, alerts, and use cost analysis tools.
- **Securing PaaS services and data storage**
  - Use Private Endpoints, managed identities, and Key Vault integration.

- **Migrate existing On-Premises infrastructure services to cloud-based solutions.**
  - This involves moving servers, applications, databases, and other IT resources from traditional on-premises data centers to cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, or GCP. The migration process typically includes:
    - **Discovery & Assessment:** Inventory all on-premises assets, analyze dependencies, and assess cloud readiness using tools like Azure Migrate or AWS Application Discovery Service.
    - **Migration Strategy:** Choose the right approachâ€”lift-and-shift (rehost), replatform, or refactor for cloud-native services. Example: Rehost a legacy Windows Server VM to Azure IaaS, or refactor a monolithic app to use Azure App Service and managed databases.
    - **Migration Execution:** Use migration tools to move VMs, databases, and workloads to the cloud. Example: Use Azure Migrate to replicate and cut over VMs, or Database Migration Service to move SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.
    - **Validation & Optimization:** Test workloads post-migration, optimize for performance, security, and cost, and decommission on-premises resources once migration is complete.
    - **Benefits:** Cloud migration enables scalability, high availability, disaster recovery, and access to modern cloud services, while reducing on-premises maintenance overhead.
  - **Tip:** Always plan for security, compliance, and business continuity during migration, and consider modernizing workloads to leverage cloud-native features for long-term value.
  

- **Develop and implement policy-driven data protection best practices to ensure cloud solutions are protected from data loss (Azure context).**
  - In Azure, data protection is achieved by combining technical controls, automation, and governance policies to prevent data loss, unauthorized access, or accidental deletion. Key best practices include:
    - **Azure Policy & Blueprints:** Use Azure Policy to enforce data protection standards (e.g., require encryption at rest, restrict public access to storage, enforce backup policies). Blueprints can automate deployment of compliant environments.
    - **Encryption:** Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all data using Azure-managed keys or customer-managed keys (CMK) in Azure Key Vault.
    - **Backups & Geo-Redundancy:** Configure automated backups for VMs, databases (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB), and storage accounts. Use geo-redundant storage (GRS) and backup vaults to protect against regional failures.
    - **Access Controls:** Apply least privilege using RBAC, managed identities, and conditional access. Use Private Endpoints to restrict data access to trusted networks.
    - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Integrate with Microsoft Purview for DLP policies, data classification, and sensitive data discovery.
    - **Monitoring & Alerts:** Use Azure Monitor and Security Center to detect anomalous activity, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration attempts.
    - **Immutable Storage & Soft Delete:** Enable soft delete and immutable blob storage for critical data to prevent accidental or malicious deletion.
    - **Regular Testing:** Periodically test backup restores and DR plans to ensure data can be recovered when needed.
  - **Example:** Enforce a policy that all storage accounts must have GRS enabled, encryption at rest, and soft delete for blobs. Use Azure Policy to audit and remediate non-compliant resources automatically.
  - **Tip:** Document your data protection strategy, automate enforcement with Azure Policy, and regularly review compliance to minimize risk of data loss.
