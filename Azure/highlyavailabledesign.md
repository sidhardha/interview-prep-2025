# Highly Available, Multi-Region Azure Application Design

## 1. High-Level Architecture Overview

### Touchpoints & Services
- **Azure Front Door (AFD) or Azure Traffic Manager (ATM):** Global HTTP/HTTPS load balancer and entry point for all internet traffic.
- **Azure Application Gateway (optional):** Regional Layer 7 load balancer, WAF, SSL termination.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or App Service:** Hosts the application backend in each region.
- **Azure SQL Database / Cosmos DB:** Geo-replicated databases for data availability.
- **Azure Storage (GRS):** Geo-redundant storage for static content/blobs.
- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet):** Secure, isolated network for resources.

## 2. Detailed Design of Each Service

### a. Azure Front Door (AFD)
- **Role:** Entry point for all user traffic; provides global load balancing, SSL offload, WAF, and health probes.
- **Design:**
  - Configured with backend pools for each region (e.g., East US, West Europe).
  - Health probes monitor regional endpoints.
  - Routes traffic to the healthiest/closest region.
  - Supports path-based routing and session affinity.

### b. Azure Traffic Manager (Alternative to AFD)
- **Role:** DNS-based global load balancer.
- **Design:**
  - Routes traffic based on performance, priority, or geographic rules.
  - Health checks for endpoints.
  - Not a proxyâ€”client connects directly to the selected region.

### c. Azure Application Gateway (per region, optional)
- **Role:** Regional Layer 7 load balancer, WAF, SSL termination.
- **Design:**
  - Sits in front of AKS/App Service in each region.
  - Provides path-based routing, WAF, and SSL offload.

### d. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) / App Service
- **Role:** Hosts application workloads.
- **Design:**
  - Deployed in multiple regions, each in at least two Availability Zones.
  - Uses internal load balancer for intra-region traffic.
  - Scales out based on demand.

### e. Azure SQL Database / Cosmos DB
- **Role:** Data storage with geo-replication.
- **Design:**
  - Azure SQL: Active geo-replication to secondary region(s).
  - Cosmos DB: Multi-region writes/reads, automatic failover.
  - Application uses connection strings with failover support.

### f. Azure Storage (GRS)
- **Role:** Stores static content, blobs, etc.
- **Design:**
  - Geo-redundant storage (GRS) replicates data to paired region.

### g. Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- **Role:** Provides network isolation and security.
- **Design:**
  - Each region has its own VNet, peered for secure communication.
  - Subnets for AKS, App Gateway, and other services.

### h. Azure Firewall/NSGs
- **Role:** Network security.
- **Design:**
  - NSGs control traffic at subnet/NIC level.
  - Azure Firewall provides centralized, stateful filtering.

### i. Azure Private Link/Endpoints
- **Role:** Secure access to PaaS services (e.g., SQL, Storage) over private IPs.
- **Design:**
  - Used to avoid exposing services to public internet.

### j. Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
- **Role:** Centralized monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- **Design:**
  - Collects metrics and logs from all regions.
  - Alerts for health, performance, and security events.

### k. Azure Key Vault
- **Role:** Secure storage for secrets, certificates, and keys.
- **Design:**
  - Accessed by app components using managed identities.

## 3. Traffic Flow: Internet to Application

1. **User Request:**
   - User accesses the application via a public URL (e.g., https://www.contoso.com).
2. **Azure Front Door (AFD):**
   - Receives the request.
   - Evaluates health and proximity of backend regions.
   - Applies WAF rules and SSL offload.
   - Forwards the request to the optimal regional endpoint (e.g., East US).
3. **Regional Entry (App Gateway, optional):**
   - Receives traffic from AFD.
   - Performs additional WAF/SSL termination.
   - Routes to AKS/App Service.
4. **Application Layer (AKS/App Service):**
   - Processes the request.
   - If data is needed, connects to Azure SQL/Cosmos DB using private endpoints.
5. **Data Layer:**
   - Reads/writes to the primary database (with geo-replication for failover).
   - Accesses Azure Storage via private endpoints.
6. **Response:**
   - Application returns response to user via the same path.
7. **Failover:**
   - If a region is unhealthy, AFD/ATM automatically routes traffic to the next healthy region.
   - Database failover is handled by geo-replication or multi-region writes.

## 5. DR & High Availability
- **Availability Zones:** Each region deploys across multiple zones for resilience.
- **Geo-Replication:** Data is replicated to secondary regions.
- **Automated Failover:** Health probes and geo-replication ensure seamless failover.
- **Regular DR Testing:** Simulate region failures and validate recovery.

---

## 6. Security Touchpoints
- WAF at AFD and App Gateway.
- NSGs and Azure Firewall for network segmentation.
- Private Endpoints for PaaS services.
- Managed identities for secure app-to-service communication.
- Key Vault for secrets.

## Highly Available, Multi-Region Application on Azure VMs with Azure SQL

### Key Components

1. **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**
   - Application servers deployed in at least two Azure regions (e.g., East US and West Europe).
   - Each region uses a VM Scale Set or Availability Set for local redundancy.

2. **Azure Load Balancer / Azure Front Door**
   - **Azure Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic within a region across VMs.
   - **Azure Front Door (AFD):** Global HTTP/HTTPS load balancer that routes user traffic to the healthiest/closest region, provides SSL offload, WAF, and health probes.

3. **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**
   - Each region has its own VNet for network isolation and security.
   - VNets can be peered for secure inter-region communication if needed.

4. **Azure SQL Database (Geo-Replicated)**
   - **Primary SQL instance** in one region, **secondary (readable) replica** in another.
   - Active geo-replication or auto-failover groups ensure data is synchronized and available in both regions.

5. **Private Endpoints**
   - Secure, private connectivity from VMs to Azure SQL, avoiding public internet exposure.

6. **Azure DNS / Traffic Manager (optional)**
   - For DNS-based routing and failover if not using AFD.

7. **Network Security Groups (NSGs) & Azure Firewall**
   - Control and secure traffic at subnet and VM NIC levels.

8. **Azure Key Vault**
   - Secure storage for connection strings, secrets, and certificates.

9. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for centralized monitoring, alerting, and diagnostics.

---

### Flow & High Availability Design

1. **User Request**
   - User accesses the application via a public URL.
   - DNS resolves to Azure Front Door (or Traffic Manager).

2. **Global Load Balancing**
   - Azure Front Door receives the request.
   - Health probes check the status of each region.
   - AFD routes the request to the optimal region (e.g., East US or West Europe) based on health, latency, or geographic rules.

3. **Regional Load Balancing**
   - Within the selected region, Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic across healthy VMs in the VM Scale Set/Availability Set.

4. **Application Layer**
   - The application running on the VM processes the request.
   - For data access, the app connects to Azure SQL Database using a private endpoint.

5. **Data Layer (Azure SQL)**
   - Application writes/reads to the primary Azure SQL instance.
   - Data is geo-replicated to the secondary region for high availability.
   - If the primary region fails, auto-failover group promotes the secondary to primary, and applications reconnect using the failover group listener endpoint.

6. **Security & Monitoring**
   - NSGs and Azure Firewall restrict and monitor traffic.
   - Azure Key Vault manages secrets and connection strings.
   - Azure Monitor and Log Analytics collect metrics, logs, and trigger alerts for failures or performance issues.

7. **Failover & Fault Tolerance**
   - If a region or VM fails:
     - Azure Front Door detects the failure via health probes and routes new traffic to the healthy region.
     - Azure SQL auto-failover group ensures database availability in the secondary region.
     - Application VMs in the secondary region continue serving users with minimal disruption.
