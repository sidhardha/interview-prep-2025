# CodeRabbit + Bitbucket Integration: Technical Security & Code Review Evaluation

---

## 1. Bitbucket Integration Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization Flow
- Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication between CodeRabbit and Bitbucket.
- Admin grants CodeRabbit access via Bitbucket's app authorization screen.
- Scopes are limited to required permissions (e.g., repo read/write, PR access).

**Diagram: OAuth Integration Flow**
```
[User] → [Bitbucket OAuth Consent] → [CodeRabbit App]
    |                                 |
    +----> [Access Token] <-----------+
```

### Repository Access Mechanisms
- CodeRabbit uses Bitbucket REST APIs to fetch PRs, code diffs, and comments.
- Webhooks are set up for PR events (opened, updated, merged).
- Access is scoped to only authorized repositories.

### Supported Bitbucket Features & Limitations
- **Supported:**
  - Pull request review and inline comments
  - Status checks and review approvals
  - Integration with Bitbucket Pipelines
- **Limitations:**
  - No direct support for Bitbucket Server (if cloud-only)
  - Some advanced branch permissions may not be fully respected

## 2. Data Privacy & Security Assessment

### Data Storage Policies & Locations
- CodeRabbit stores minimal metadata (PR IDs, review status) in encrypted cloud storage (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Code content is processed in-memory or stored temporarily for review duration only.
- Data residency options may be available for enterprise customers.

### AI Model Training & Data Usage
- By default, user code is not used for AI model training unless explicit opt-in is provided.
- Training datasets are anonymized and scrubbed of PII/secrets.
- No code is shared with third parties without consent.

### Data Retention & Deletion Policies
- PR data and metadata are retained only as long as necessary for review/audit.
- Users can request deletion of all stored data via dashboard or support.
- Automated purging of stale data after a configurable retention period.

### Encryption Methods
- **At Rest:** AES-256 encryption for all stored data.
- **In Transit:** TLS 1.2+ for all API and webhook communications.

## 3. Code Review Security Features

### Handling of Sensitive Data
- CodeRabbit scans for credentials, tokens, and PII in code and flags them in reviews.
- Sensitive data is masked in logs and reports.

### Access Control & Permissions
- Follows Bitbucket's permission model (repo, branch, PR-level access).
- Only authorized users can trigger reviews or view results.
- Supports SSO/SAML for enterprise access control.

### Compliance with Industry Standards
- GDPR-compliant data handling and user rights.
- SOC 2 controls for data security, availability, and confidentiality.
- Regular third-party security assessments and penetration tests.

### Third-Party Integration Security
- All integrations (e.g., Slack, Jira) use OAuth or signed webhooks.
- No sensitive data is shared with third parties without explicit user action.

## 4. Code Review Process

### Automated Review Workflow
1. Developer opens a PR in Bitbucket.
2. Webhook triggers CodeRabbit review.
3. CodeRabbit fetches code diff, runs static analysis, and posts inline comments.
4. Developer addresses feedback; CodeRabbit re-reviews on update.
5. Review status and metrics are updated in Bitbucket.

**Diagram: Automated Review Workflow**
```
[PR Opened] → [Webhook] → [CodeRabbit Review]
    |                |
    +----> [Inline Feedback] → [Dev Fixes] → [Re-review]
```

### Supported Languages & Frameworks
- Supports major languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Ruby, etc.
- Framework-specific rules for React, Django, Spring, .NET, Node.js, etc.

### Static Code Analysis
- Checks for code quality, style, complexity, and anti-patterns.
- Customizable rulesets per project/team.

### Security Vulnerability Scanning
- Scans for OWASP Top 10, SAST vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, and dependency issues.
- Integrates with Snyk or similar tools for dependency scanning.

### AI-Powered Suggestions
- Contextual code improvements, refactoring, and best practice recommendations.
- Learns from team review patterns for tailored feedback.

## 5. Audit & Monitoring

### Activity Logging & Audit Trails
- All review actions, comments, and status changes are logged with timestamps and user IDs.
- Immutable audit logs for compliance and forensics.

### Monitoring Security Events
- Real-time monitoring for suspicious activity (e.g., unauthorized access, excessive data export).
- Alerts for failed logins, permission changes, and integration events.

### Compliance Reporting
- Exportable reports for audit/compliance (GDPR, SOC 2, etc.).
- Dashboard for review metrics, security findings, and remediation status.

### Incident Response Procedures
- 24/7 monitoring and incident response team.
- Documented playbooks for breach detection, containment, and notification.
- User notification and support for data incidents.

---

## Security Recommendations
- Enable SSO/SAML and enforce strong authentication for all users.
- Regularly review and limit CodeRabbit's access scopes in Bitbucket.
- Use custom rules to flag sensitive data and enforce secure coding standards.
- Periodically export and review audit logs for unusual activity.
- Stay updated on CodeRabbit and Bitbucket security advisories.
